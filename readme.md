## Synopsis

[ColorPikr](http://colorpikr.com) is a mobile web tool intended for Instagram story users to put text over a solid color background. It lets a user shuffle a color palette until they see a color they like. They can select the color and select the download icon to download the icon to their device. Then, they can use that swatch as a photo to upload to Instagram stories and put text over it.

It became trendy to put text or other edits to solid color backgrounds in Instagram stories. Instagram does not give the ability to add solid color backgrounds so this makes it easy to get a color swatch and edit over it in Instagram.
